## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Restore reader state on start

The system SHALL persist the reader's selection when the application quits and
restore it when the application starts again. The persisted selection SHALL
record the current view (list or article), the row under the cursor (the
article by its ID, or the day group by its calendar-day key when the cursor is
on a day header), and, when the article view is open, the article's scroll
offset. On startup the system SHALL move the list cursor to the row matching
the saved selection. When the saved view is the article view and the saved
article still exists, the system SHALL open that article and restore its scroll
offset, so that returning to the list (via `b`, `esc`, or `h`) leaves the same
article selected. When the saved selection no longer exists — for example the
article was pruned or the day group changed — the system SHALL fall back to the
default clamped cursor without error.

#### Scenario: List cursor restored on start

- **WHEN** the user quits with the cursor on an article row in the list view and restarts
- **THEN** the list cursor is on that same article's row

#### Scenario: Day header selection restored on start

- **WHEN** the user quits with the cursor on a day-header row and restarts
- **THEN** the list cursor is on that day group's header row

#### Scenario: Article view reopened on start

- **WHEN** the user quits while reading an article and restarts
- **THEN** the reader reopens that article, and pressing `b`, `esc`, or `h` returns to the list with that article still selected

#### Scenario: Article scroll position restored on start

- **WHEN** the user quits while reading an article scrolled partway and restarts
- **THEN** the reopened article is scrolled to the same position

#### Scenario: Fallback when the saved article no longer exists

- **WHEN** the saved article was removed from the store and the user restarts
- **THEN** the list opens with the default cursor and the application does not error
